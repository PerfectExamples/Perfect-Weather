An Example Weather App Backend for Perfect

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate using URL Routes & variables, Fetching of remote data from API's as JSON, reading and transforming to data more appropriately consumable by an API client.

Packages demonstrated:
* PerfectLib (JSON)
* HTTPServer
* CURL
* [JSONConfig](https://github.com/iamjono/JSONConfig) (3rd party library for reading configurations)

This package builds with Swift Package Manager and is part of the [Perfect](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect) project.

Ensure you have installed Xcode 8.0 or later.

## Obtaining an API Key

This example project requires a valid API key from [https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) to function. Use this link to sign up for a developer account, and obtain an API key.

This key will be added to the `ApplicationConfiguration.json` file as described below.

## Setup - Xcode 8

* Check out or download the project;
* In terminal, navigate to the directory and execute

```
swift package generate-xcodeproj
```

* Open `Perfect-Weather.xcodeproj`
* Add to the "Library Search Paths" in "Project Settings" `$(PROJECT_DIR)`, recursive. **(This step will be unneeded in a future release of Xcode 8.)**
* Rename the `ApplicationConfiguration.json.example` file to 	`ApplicationConfiguration.json`. 
* Open this file and change the `token` value to the WeatherUnderground token obtained above.
* Add the file to a new "Copy Files" build phase as shown:

![https://github.com/PerfectExamples/Perfect-Weather/raw/master/Resource/CopyFilesPhase.png](https://github.com/PerfectExamples/Perfect-Weather/raw/master/Resource/CopyFilesPhase.png)

* Select the Executable build target from the build targets dropdown in Xcode
* Run (cmd-R) to build & run in Xcode.

In Xcode's console output pane you will see:

```
[INFO] Starting HTTP server on 0.0.0.0:8181 with document root ./webroot
```

* In a browser, visit [http://localhost:8181/api/v1/current](http://localhost:8181/api/v1/current)

## Setup - Terminal

* Check out or download the project;
* In terminal, navigate to the directory 
* * Rename the `ApplicationConfiguration.json.example` file to 	`ApplicationConfiguration.json`. 
* Open this file and change the `token` value to the WeatherUnderground token obtained above.
* Execute `swift build`
* Once the project has compiled, execute `./.build/debug/Perfect-Weather`

The output you will see:

```
[INFO] Starting HTTP server on 0.0.0.0:8181 with document root ./webroot
```

* In a browser, visit [http://localhost:8181/api/v1/current](http://localhost:8181/api/v1/current)

## Included Routes

The following routes are included in this API for demonstration purposes:

* GET: [http://localhost:8181/api/v1/current](http://localhost:8181/api/v1/current) - A route that returns the current weather conditions for the default location, Canada/Newmarket.
* GET: [http://localhost:8181/api/v1/forecast](http://localhost:8181/api/v1/forecast) - A route that returns the weather forecast for the default location, Canada/Newmarket.
* GET: [http://localhost:8181/api/v1/current/{country}/{city}](http://localhost:8181/api/v1/current/{country}/{city}) - A route that returns the current weather conditions for the specified country and city. Make sure you replace `{country}` and `{city}` with valid values.
* GET: [http://localhost:8181/api/v1/forecast/{country}/{city}](http://localhost:8181/api/v1/forecast/{country}/{city}) - A route that returns the weather forecast for the specified country and city. Make sure you replace `{country}` and `{city}` with valid values.
